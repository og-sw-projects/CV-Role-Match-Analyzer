# CV-to-Role Match Analyzer

## Project Overview

The core functionality of the CV-to-Role Match Analyzer revolves around comparing the skills and qualifications presented in a CV with the requirements outlined in a job description.  This comparison goes beyond simple keyword matching and aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the candidate's fit.

The output JSON file includes the following key information:

*   **Numerical Match Score (0-100):** A quantitative measure representing the overall compatibility between the CV and the job description.  A higher score indicates a better match.
*   **Categorized Skill Gaps:** Identification of specific skills and qualifications mentioned in the job description that are missing or underrepresented in the CV.
*   **Specific Improvement Recommendations:**  Actionable suggestions for the candidate to improve their CV and better align it with the target role.  These recommendations might include highlighting relevant projects, acquiring new skills, or rephrasing existing experience.

#### Key Features

*   **Automated Analysis:**  Eliminates the need for manual CV screening, saving recruiters valuable time.
*   **Objective Evaluation:**  Provides a data-driven approach to candidate assessment, reducing bias and promoting fairness.
*   **Detailed Insights:**  Offers granular information about skill gaps and areas for improvement, facilitating more targeted feedback.
*   **JSON Output:**  Enables easy integration with other recruitment systems and tools.
*   **PDF Input:** Accepts CVs and Job Descriptions in the commonly used PDF format.

#### Target Audience

This tool is beneficial for:

*   **Recruiters:**  Quickly identify qualified candidates and prioritize their applications.
*   **Hiring Managers:**  Gain a deeper understanding of candidate strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Job Seekers:**  Identify areas where their CV can be improved to better match target roles.

#### Technical Stack

*   Programming Language: Python
*   Libraries/Frameworks: click, google-genai, python-dotenv, pytest, pypdf

## Projet Phases - Architecture
#### Command-line Interface Specification
```bash
# Main analysis command
cvanalyzer analyze --cv <path_to_pdf> --role <path_to_txt>

# Optional parameters
cvanalyzer analyze --cv <path_to_pdf> --role <path_to_txt> --output-dir <path>
cvanalyzer analyze --cv <path_to_pdf> --role <path_to_txt> --verbose [0|1|2]

# Utility commands
cvanalyzer --help
cvanalyzer --version
```
#### File System Interactions
The system interacts with files in the following manner:
- Input Files:
  - CV: PDF format.
  - Role Description: Text file.
- Output Files:
  - Analysis Report: JSON format containing match score, skill gaps, and recommendations. Output directory can be specified via command line. If not specified, a default output location will be used.
- Temporary Files:
  - The system utilizes temporary files during analysis. These files are automatically managed and cleaned up by the system.

#### Third-Party Libraries
The system leverages third-party libraries for specific functionalities:
- `click` - Command-line interface management.
- `google-genai` - Large Language Model (LLM) API integration.
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variables management.
- `pytest` - Testing
- `pytest-mock` - Mock for testing
- `pypdf` - PDF processing and text extraction.

#### Team Member Responsibilities
The project is divided into two main areas of responsibility:
- Data Handling and Interface: This area encompasses managing input data (CV and role description), interacting with the file system, and providing the command-line interface.
- Analysis and LLM Integration: This area focuses on integrating with the LLM API, developing the analysis algorithms, and generating the final report.

Both team members share responsibility for code review, documentation, integration testing, and performance optimization.

## Project Phases - Coding & Testing

### Coding
  
| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `cv_analyzer.py` | ontains the core logic for analyzing CVs and job descriptions, orchestrating the overall flow of analysis, and managing the command-line interface using Click. |
| `llm.py` | Manages the interaction with the Gemini API for analyzing the match between the CV and job description using an LLM-based approach. |
| `report.py` | Responsible for formatting and outputting the analysis results in a structured format (e.g., JSON), representing the CV-job description match. |
| `utils.py` | Contains helper functions for tasks like file handling, text extraction, and other common operations that support the core functionality. |
| `validation.py` | Validates the input paths (CV and job description files), ensuring that files exist and are in the correct format before analysis. |

### Testing
- **Automated Unit Test** [test_analyze_match.py](./tests/unit/test_analyze_match.py): A unit test for the `analyze_match` function in the `LLMClient` class. This test checks various scenarios of matching CV and job role text including successful match with valid responses and handling of exceptions when `LLMClient.analyze_match` raises an error.

- **System-level Functional Test** [test_system.py](./tests/system/test_system.py): A system test for the core functionality of the `analyze_core` function in the `CVAnalyzer` class. This system test evaluates the end-to-end workflow of the application, orchestrated by the `analyze_core` function. It ensures that the core functionality of processing CV and job role text is working as expected.
