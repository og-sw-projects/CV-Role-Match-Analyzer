Prompt:


Suggest 3 or more significant and interesting CV analysis features. The features suggested should have the following attribues where Python will be the programming language for the implementation:
* The implementation of the feature should be well suited for depending heavily on feature engineering with Gemini API free version.  
* The implementation of the feature should be well suited for using at least one well known third party library for a significant part of the implementation.
* The implementation should have its complexity focused in prompt engineering.
* The implementation should not include API services that are not free or demand registration in a any form except for Gemini API free version.

   * Multi-step prompting to first extract CV components
   * Chain-of-thought prompts to analyze each section against role requirements
   * Structured output prompts for generating specific improvement recommendations
* Key Third-Party Libraries:
   * PyPDF2 for PDF extraction
   * pandas for structured data organization
* Complex Prompt Aspects:
   * Role requirement identification
   * Skill mapping and gap analysis
   * Experience relevance scoring
   * Custom rubric application through prompting
2. Achievement Statement Enhancer

Each feature emphasizes:
1. Heavy prompt engineering focus
2. Uses only Gemini's free API
3. Leverages common, free Python libraries
4. Requires no external API services
5. No registration requirements beyond Gemini
6. Clear scope for implementation
7. Produces meaningful output
Would you like me to detail the prompt engineering complexity for any of these features? I can break down the prompt chain structure and explain how it would work with Gemini's capabilities.
